# Presentation
My initial process was to work out how I wanted the website to interact, primarily What information would be beneficial to place on the Home page?  
I had some particular designs I knew I wanted to implement:
- Shared Navigation bar in desktop Containing "Home" "About" "Contact" and "Blog"
- I wanted to Blog navigation menu to drop down on hover or active to link directly to the 5 articles
- I wanted the Blog page to have page links to the 5 articles
- I want to Contact page to have input fields for The users name, email address and a short message
- I want the About page to be partially explaining my technical skills and partially showing my personal life. <strong>THIS NEEDS TO LINK TO PDF RESUME</strong>
- The home page was a struggle to figure what should appear, I know it needs a decent sized graphic to get attention and some sort of animation.

## Responsive Design
Wireframe worked to build desktop first, and css was then built for a mobile first design.  
I wanted to take how many sites do their menus using a hamburger menu in mobile appear in the left corner of the page.

## Navigation bar
As described I really wanted a navigation bar that also contained a drop down. I inspected a few sites, and found an extremely hand guide that I was able to pull from: [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_dropdown_navbar.asp) This led me to explore fields such as z-index and 'float'  
The build of the naviagtion bar was a difficult aspect of the build that I got much satisfaction out of completing.
